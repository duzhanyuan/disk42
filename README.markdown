### Introduction

disk42 is an online Cloud storage service that encrypts files for syncing and sharing. Our service is focused on user privacy and data security. All files uploaded to our servers are encrypted on users’ devices before being saved in the Cloud. To ensure maximum security, our users’ passwords are never sent to the server.

We use open source code to guarantee maximum security. disk42 is based on other open source projects such as nginx, MariaDB and (in particular) Seafile, the project of the great people of Haiwen.


### Our Aims

- We will focus on data security and privacy
- We will encrypt all files prior to uploading
- We will never send users’ passwords to our server
- We will work hard to improve the user experience of secure file sharing
- We will provide transparency by making our entire code open source


### Our Motivation

We are certainly not the first file synchronization service. There are many well-known  online file storage companies, such as Dropbox, Microsoft One Drive and Google Drive. 

However, the problem with these services is that they upload your files to their servers in an unencrypted form. This means that the service provider can access your files at any time. They can also give the NSA and other governmental agencies full access to your documents.

We are offering a service where your private data stays private.

We started disk42 in late 2014 because there is a gap in the market. We want to provide a Cloud storage service with real data security. We will do this by ensuring that each file has strong end-to-end encryption. We offer complete transparency because we use 100% open source code.
